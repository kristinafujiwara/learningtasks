				<h1 class = "ititle"> What is Poverty? </h1>
				<h3 class = "iintro"> Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs, including food, clothing, and shelter. However, poverty is more
                                        than just not having enough money. It is a state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources
                                        and essentials for aminimum standard of living. Poverty means that the income level from employment is so low that basic
                                        human needs cannot be met.
				<h3 class = "iintrocon"> Poverty-stricken people and families might go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention.
											When people are excluded within a society, when they are not well educated and have a higher incidence of illness,
											there are negative consequences for society. We all pay the price for poverty. The increased cost on the health system,
											the justice system, and other systems that support those living in poverty impact our economy.</h3>

			<h2 class = "effects"> Effects of Poverty </h2>
			<p class = "effect1"> &#8226 Inability to Afford Housing </p>
			<p class = "e1desc"> With poverty plaguing the country and scarce employment opportunities, many Filipinos cannot afford housing, which puts them in
									danger of turning to the streets for accommodation. </p>
			<p class = "effect2"> &#8226 Malnutrition in the Philippines </p>
			<p class = "e2desc"> Hunger is one of the extreme effects of poverty in the Philippines. With little money to buy food, Filipinos have to survive on
									minimal food; even when food supplies are stable, they are most accessible in other areas where people have enough income to
									purchase the food. </p>
			<p class = "effect3"> &#8226 Child Labor </p>
			<p class = "e3desc"> With poverty taking a toll on Filipinos, parents often cannot make enough money to support their families; children then have to
									be taken out of school to work in harsh conditions. </p>
			<p class = "effect4"> &#8226 Crime and Thievery </p>
			<p class = "e4desc"> People often resort to crime and thievery with conditions so troublesome to survive. There are too many people and not enough
									resources. Moreover, people become desperate and practice drastic measures to provide for themselves and their families with
									such conditions.</p>
