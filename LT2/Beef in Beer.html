		<h2> Ingredients </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> <p> 500g of cheap beef pieces (stewing steak usually is cheap) </p> </li>
			<li> <p> 500 pcs of real ale </p> </li>
			<li> <p> 4 large onions </p> </li>
			<li> <p> 2 fat cloves of garlic </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Tbsp of plain flour </p> </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Method </h2>
		<ol>
			<li> <p> Raw beef, roll it in the flour. Fry 4-5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to seal. Put to one side when all done. </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Cut the onions into quarters. Fry in the same frying pan as the beef to soak up the juices. </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Towards the end of frying the onion (they should be nicely brown round the edges) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic. </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining flour </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Pour on the bottle of beer - really, it isn't going to be wasted!!! </p> </li>
			<li> <p> Cover, and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours...will be gorgeous when it comes out, trust me. Serve with mash. </p> </li>
