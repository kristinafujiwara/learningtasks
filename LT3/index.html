		<h1> My Top 10 Favorite Songs </h1>

		<div id = "songs">
			<div>
				<h2> Top 1 </h2>
				<img src = "euphoria.jpg" title = "Euphoria" alt = "Image of Euphoria" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Euphoria </h3>
				<p> This is my top 1 favorite song because it is sung by my bias in BTS which is Jungkook. &#8220Euphoria&#8221 is a feel-good song, depicting the happiness associated with young love and new beginnings. There is an underlying tone of how love is fake and not based on attraction. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2> Top 2 </h2>
				<img src = "answer love myself.jpg" title = "Answer: Love Myself" alt = "Image of Answer: Love Myself" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Answer: Love Myself </h3>
				<p> This is my top 2 in the list because the meaning is quite obvious in the title of the song itself. The lyrics resolve the struggles of BTS explaining self love. It expresses the importance of wholeheartedly loving yourself and BTS&apos; gratitude for their fans for bringing them to this conclusion. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
                		<h2> Top 3 </h2>
				<img src = "life goes on.jpg" title = "Life Goes On" alt = "Image of Life Goes On" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Life Goes On </h3>
				<p> This is a song by BTS and they released it last October 30, 2020 at the peak of the pandemic. The lyrics of this song are offering comfort in times when the world faces the pandemic. The story behind the song declares that even in the face of this new normality, our life goes on and imparts a message of healing to fans and to the world. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2> Top 4 </h2>
				<img src = "spring day.jpg" title = "Spring Day" alt = "Image of Spring Day" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Spring Day </h3>
				<p> The song&apos;s lyrics give a positive light over a friend&apos;s absence, utilizing a seasonal metaphor to deliberate on how things will get better afterward. Also, this song symbolizes what happened in the sinking of Sewol Ferry last April 16, 2014. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<h2> Top 5 </h2>
				<img src = "waste it on me.jpg" title = "Waste it on Me" alt = "Image of Waste it on Me" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Waste it on Me </h3>
				<p> The lyrics of this song depict both a hopeless and hopeful love affair. While one side of the relationship labels the concept of love as a waste, the other strongly advocates for the pursuit. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2> Top 6 </h2>
				<img src = "renegades.jpg" title = "Renegades" alt = "Image of Renegades" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Renegades </h3>
				<p> This is one of my favorites too because it is sung by my favorite Japanese band called One Ok Rock. The song sees the band fight for what they value despite the tinted glasses that they may face and makes their voices get heard by the &#8220broken&#8221 political system. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2> Top 7 </h2>
				<img src = "fake love.jpg" title = "Fake Love" alt = "Image of Fake Love" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Fake Love </h3>
				<p> The song's meaning is about one realizing his love, which he thought was fate, but it turned out to be fake love. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
                		<h2> Top 8 </h2>
				<img src = "yoru ni kakeru.jpg" title = "Yoru ni Kakeru" alt = "Image of Yoru ni Kakeru" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Yoru ni Kakeru (Racing Into the Night)  </h3>
				<p> It's a catchy song but the meaning behind this song is deep. The song portrays a man who meets a suicidal girl and falls for her. She is attracted to 'death' and always attempts to commit suicide but everytime she does, the man will talk her down and prevent her from doing so. It also says that the God of death will resemble one's ideal person. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
                		<h2> Top 9 </h2>
				<img src = "butterfly.png" title = "Butterfly" alt = "Image of Butterfly" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> Butterfly </h3>
				<p> At first glance, the title of the lyrics looks pretty but the meaning behind this song is deep. The lyrics of this song express the fear of losing someone through the simile of a butterfly. The butterfly could be interpreted as representing the ephemerality of time that risks being lost at a moment&apos;s notice. </p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h2> Top 10 </h2>
				<img src = "stay.png" title = "STAY" alt = "Image of STAY" width = 267 height = 267>
				<h3> STAY </h3>
				<p> This is also my favorite song and it is a collaboration between The Kid LAROI and Justin Bieber which details LAROI&apos;s wish for his lover&apos;s forgiveness and Bieber&apos;s admiration for his significant other. </p>
